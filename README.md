# Food Delivery Time Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to predict food delivery times based on historical data. The model analyzes various factors such as order time, restaurant location, delivery distance, traffic conditions, and weather to provide accurate time estimates.

## Features
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Uses LSTM for sequential data prediction.
- **Real-World Factors**: Considers location, traffic, weather, and order details.
- **Improved Delivery Accuracy**: Helps optimize delivery logistics and enhance customer satisfaction.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes data for better model performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for data preprocessing)

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **Order Time**
- **Restaurant Location**
- **Delivery Distance**
- **Traffic Conditions**
- **Weather Data**
- **Actual Delivery Time**

## Usage
- Train the model using historical data.
- Input new order details to predict the estimated delivery time.
- Integrate predictions into a food delivery platform.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time traffic API.
- Improve model accuracy with additional features.
- Deploy as an API for real-time predictions.
